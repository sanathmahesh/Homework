            In total, humans have pumped around 2,500bn tonnes of CO2 (GtCO2) into the atmosphere since 1850, leaving less than 500GtCO2 of the remaining carbon budget to stay below 1.5C of warming.

            This means that, by the end of 2021, the world will collectively have burned through 86% of the carbon budget for a 50-50 probability of staying below 1.5C, or 89% of the budget for a two-thirds likelihood.

            In first place on the rankings, the US has released more than 509GtCO2 since 1850 and is responsible for the largest share of historical emissions, Carbon Brief analysis shows, with some 20% of the global total.

          <h2>Does GDP affect Carbon Emissions?</h2>
          <p>Volatility in global economic activity in the past two years has highlighted the linkages that still remain between global carbon dioxide emissions (CO2) and world GDP growth</p>
          <p>Emissions fell during the global recession in 2020 but then grew in line with the recovery in world GDP in 2021, the first year since 2010 when the carbon intensity of global GDP (emissions per unit of GDP) failed to improve.</p>
          <p>Breaking the link between emissions and GDP will be crucial to achieving climate goals given that world GDP is expected to continue rising at around 2.5%-3% over the next two decades.</p>
          <p>The carbon intensity of GDP has fallen by 45% since 1965 but most of this reflects improved energy efficiency.</p>
          <p>The carbon intensity of energy has improved only very modestly since the late 1990s, reflecting the rapid increase in China’s share of global energy consumption after 2000 and its relatively high reliance on coal.</p>
          <p>Energy efficiency improved further in 2021 but this was fully offset by an estimated 1.4% increase in the carbon intensity of energy, the worst performance since 2003.</p>

            <p>
              Most climate change experts agree that greenhouse gases ― which trap heat and prevent it from leaving the Earth's atmosphere ― are mostly responsible for the temperature spike. Even with a worldwide emphasis on reduced greenhouse emissions, temperatures continue to climb.

              The most common causes of death related to rising temperatures include heat exhaustion, heat stroke, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease and aggravated allergies. In addition to the human toll, there is also a significant financial impact to consider.

              'Killer Summer Heat' discusses a heat wave that struck California in Summer 2006. Over the two-week period of extreme heat, 655 people lost their lives and more than 16,000 individuals made trips to the emergency room; the heatwave ultimately resulted in costs nearing $5.3 billion.

            <p>While the chart above shows the mean temperature anomaly through the years, take a look at the maximum temperatures of days from 1984 and 2021.
              <br><br>We can clearly see that, on average, there are more high temperature days in 2021 when compared to 1984.<br><br> This clearly shows that greenhouse gas emissions are directly correlated with global warming.
